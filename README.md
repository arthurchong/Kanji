# Introduction
Before we started making our prototype, we had to understand the current sustainability issues prevalent. So, let’s take a look at the problems through the eyes of Rachel, a student in Ngee Ann Poly just like us. 

## Rachel Scenario (Persona)
This is how Rachel normally would live out her day. She takeaways her breakfast coffee and kaya toast for the sake of convenience. She doesn’t think much of it after all its just a small plastic cup and plastic bag. In the afternoon, a sudden meeting crops up and she has to takeaway her lunch in a Styrofoam box. Then comes the evening where Rachel again buys back her favorite fish ball noodles using a plastic container because she has work to rush back at home.
As Rachel is swamped by work, she does not keep track of the number disposable she uses. The amount almost seems to be negligible. But what if everyone were like Rachel. This would be more than 1.5 million kilograms of carbon waste created per day, equivalent to the weight of 5 Boeings. 
So, our team wanted to know why people like Rachel don’t care about the impact of their habits as much as they should. Using the RANAS model, we broke down both the psychological and physical barriers that Rachel potentially faces. 
    -	One of the few main reasons being unable to perceive the collective impact of her daily carbon footprint
    -	as well as feeling unmotivated to go the extra step to tackle carbon waste. 
    
## Using the result from the RANAS model
the team have summed up the needs into 3 main categories, Education, Encouragement and Empowerment. 

## Seeing through the lens of Corporate and Governance
But we cannot only view the problem through the eyes of consumers. Thus, we have attended events of different organizations to also understand the issue from their perspective. The overall problems that we have gathered are 
1.	Carbon footprint is concealed and not readily accessible
2.	Unsustainable consumerism is responsible for 60% of global greenhouse gas emissions 
3.	Singaporeans are aware of environmental issues but there is a lag in the adoption of green practices. 
Our chosen target demographic are tertiary students. They are impressionable social media savvy individuals like us suffering with eco-anxiety as the climate impacts of our actions affect them directly. 


## Solution Introduction
With our problem and target demographic chosen, we created our solution : Narnia, with the 3 main needs in mind, aiming to target the problem from every perspective as a whole ecosystem. 

EDUCATE
Our planned approach for educating our target demographic is by setting up information exhibits as well as hosting industrial talks. We believe that by providing our audience with up-to-date information through continual engagement and routinal education with the use of Narnia can prove to be effective. 
However, it may to become mundane for users in the long run. To combat this issue we plan to boost engagement by mobilizing crowds through gamification. Taking advantage of social media, we can also partner with organizations like Sqkii  (who are experienced in the gamification sector)to motivate the use of Narnia.
To measure the impact and success of our projects, surveys can be conducted on the awareness of carbon waste after such events, as well as monitoring the aggregate amount of carbon waste generated after, to track behavioral patterns. 

EMPOWER
Our planned approach is to encourage introspective thinking among students  through visual charting of their carbon waste. Visual charting will be aggregated with other user's carbon waste through the leaderboard in our Narnia app. Our aim is to help individual more conscious about the problem of carbon waste and empowered to make a difference through forming the habit of carbon resilience in their daily life. 

ENCOURAGE
We have dedicated marketing strategy that involves relevant stakeholders to the Narnia solution and Kanji objective. For instance, the team can Use Instagram & Tiktok to share tidbits of information on how students can promote sustainability everyday

Narnia
Narnia is an app that provides an experiential learning for user designed with gamification in mind. For instance, user of a department can compete with other departments within their organization in our leaderboard page to achieve the highest scoring.


# Narnia
Team Kanji uses AppGyver, a free-to-use no code application development to develop our Narnia solution. We uses API calls to Google Firebase for backend database and Google AI for our AI Scanner.

# Limitation 
Only work in IOS, regrettably.
